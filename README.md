# BASIC Examples
These are some simple examples of the BASIC programming language written for the Tandy Color Computer 3. However, all of the text programs should work in any BASIC interpreter! 

I made these as a docent at the Isett Heritage Museum in Huntingdon, PA as quick programs guests could enter to try out the CoCo 3 while on a tour!
