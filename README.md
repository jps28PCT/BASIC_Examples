# BASIC_Examples
This is some simple examples of the BASIC programming language written for the Tandy Color Computer 3. However, all of the text programs should work in any BASIC interpreter! 

I made these as a docent at the Isett Heritage Museum in Huntingdon, PA as quick programs guests could enter to try out the CoCo 3 while on a tour!
